# Mob Healthbar plugin

Tiny Paper plugin that shows a mob's current health to the attacker when they deal damage.
Uses Paper's Adventure API to send an action bar message.

## What it does

When you damage a mob, you see something like:

`Zombie 12.4 / 20 ❤`

If the mob has absorption, it also shows that in gold:

`Zombie 12.4 / 20 ❤ +4 ❤`

## Requirements

- Java 17
- Paper 1.19.2
